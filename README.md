# Nexus Lifecycle config-as-code

This project provides the capability to automate the configuration of the IQ Server, by applying configuration data 
from JSON config file(s). It further supports the capability to 'scrape' existing config and persist to JSON config files
from where it can be re-applied. This capability supports Sonatype customers aspiration to stand-up/tear-down an IQ 
environment in support of business continuity and service resiliency. 

Configuration is applied in 2 layers:

    1. System
    2. 

    2. Organization

The conf directory contains files for individual configuration items in addition to the system-conf.json and 
example-org.json that correspond with the aforementioned layers. Default data contained within the config files will 
need to be modified. Please discuss this with your Sonatype CSE.


Usage

    $ python3 iq-scrape-conf.py --help

    $ python3 iq-apply-conf.py --help

Usage: iq-apply-config [ARGS]...

  Example usage:

    # Run python script though docker container with all packages installed on it!
    docker run -w /tmp --rm -i -v $PWD:/tmp broadinstitute/python-requests /tmp/iq-apply-conf.py -f /tmp/conf/<conf-file>.json -u http://<iq-hostname>:<iq-port> -a <user>:<password>

    # Run the script natively on your host
    python3 iq-apply-conf.py -f conf/<conf-file>.json -a <user>:<password> -u <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>
    python3 iq-apply-conf.py -f scrape/System-Config.json  -a <user>:<password> -u <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>
    python3 iq-apply-conf.py -f scrape/All-Organizations-Config.json  -a <user>:<password> -u <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>


Usage: iq-scrape-config [ARGS]...

  Example usage:

    # Run python script though docker container with all packages installed on it!
    docker run -w /tmp --rm -i -v $PWD:/tmp broadinstitute/python-requests iq-scrape-conf.py -u "http://<iq-hostname>:<iq-port>"

    # Run the script natively on your host
    python3 iq-scrape-conf.py  -a <user>:<password> -u <protocol>://<hostname>:<port> -o /tmp

Options:

      -u, --url           Nexus IQ Server URL   # defaults to http://localhost:8070

      -a, --auth          Authentication. <user-id>:<password>      # defaults to admin:admin123

      -d, --debug         Debug mode.           # defaults to False

      -f, --file_name     <config-file>.json    # iq-apply_conf.py only
      
      -o, --output        <output-path>         # iq-scrape-conf.py only - defaults to ./scrape

Limitations/Scope:

      These scripts use some private APIs that may change without prior notice. 
      
      SAML configuration is not supported.
      
      Policies are nogt supported. See: https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008133574

      The 'roles' API does not return the role permissionCategories via the GET call. Therefore this data cannot be scraped and persisted. 
      Custom Role permissions must be re-applied.

      All password/token values are not returned when scraping config to JSON files. You will need to search the scrape/<config.json> 
      file and replace the #~FAKE~SECRET~KEY~# entries.

      The email server account password is null when scraped. A boolean flag to denote password present defaults to 'false'. Be sure to 
      address this when editing this data, ahead of applying it to another environment.
